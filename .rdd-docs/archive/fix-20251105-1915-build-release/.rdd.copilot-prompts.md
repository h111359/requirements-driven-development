## Stand Alone Prompts

Prompts that the agent execute - follow the instructions which prompts to be executed. If nothing provided - execute only one prompt - the first not executed and stop. When a given prompt is executed, the checkbox in front of it should be marked. Changing the checkbox to `- [x]` is **the only change you are allowed to do**. Never change anything else than marking a checkbox! 

 - [x] [P01] I want my repo to have a process for creation of releases in the github repo. Analyze the files in .rdd-docs folder (the requirements and specifications), the scripts in `.rdd/scripts` and the prompts in `.github/prompts`. Then create a research in Internet for best practices which can be applied in the situation of the current project for builds, releases, naming conventions, needed scripts and automations, CI/CD components, etc. A possible approach could be (but not limit yourself to it) could be:
   * The release to contain build as a zip file, which to be able to be downloaded and installed. It is expected on the user machine to be installed Python. The build should also contain a Python script which installs the tool and README.md file which explains the installation. In the installation shoul be included the following files:
       * all prompts in the folder `.github/prompts` should be copied in folder `.github/prompts` in the target folder. If the folder does not exists - to be created. 
       * The whole folder `.rdd` to be copied in the target folder as it is
       * The content of `.rdd/templates/settings.json to be merged in the respective sections of the target folder file `.vscode/settings.json` (to be created if missing)
       * To be added ".rdd-docs/workspace/" in the .gitignore file in the root target folder
Write the analysis in the prompt implementation file. Do not execute yet, but propose a prompt for the next step to implement it.
  
 - [x] [P02] Read `.rdd-docs/workspace/P01-implementation.md`. Create a file build-implementation-plan.md as modification of the file `.rdd-docs/workspace/P01-implementation.md`, where are only "Option C: Zip Archive with Installer" is considered. Also do not use `scripts/build.sh` any more - this file will be removed. Create a new python file scripts/build.py with the logic needed. Also revise the proposed prompts and write them in bigger detail and verbose style so to be absolutely clear what should be done.

 - [x] [P03] Implement accordingly `.rdd-docs/workspace/build-implementation-plan.md`
 
 - [x] [P04] Analyse `scripts/build.py`. Modify so the README.md generated to have instructions for Windows along with those for Linux. Also create installation shell scripts both for Windows and Linux so no need the user to execute python script themselves. The shell scripts to provide the user with visualy appealing navigation menu with choices where to be installed RDD framework which menu to be navigatable with keystrokes (arrow keys) and selection to be made with space or enter. The user should be able to navigate from the current folder to upper folder or subfolder.

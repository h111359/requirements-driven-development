Refined P01 analysis to remove legacy bash script approach and design Python-only build system with scripts/build.py replacing scripts/build.sh. Created detailed verbose prompts P03-P07 for implementing: build.py script, install.py installer, GitHub Actions workflow, documentation updates, and comprehensive testing. Also created build-implementation-plan.md as standalone reference document with architecture, flows, and implementation details.", "sessionId": "exec-20251105-2103"}

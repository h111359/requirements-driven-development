## Stand Alone Prompts

Prompts that the agent execute - follow the instructions which prompts to be executed. If nothing provided - execute only one prompt - the first not executed and stop. When a given prompt is executed, the checkbox in front of it should be marked. Changing the checkbox to `- [x]` is **the only change you are allowed to do**. Never change anything else than marking a checkbox! 

 - [x] [P01] To be created a file `templates/user-guide.md` which to explain in detail how the user should work with the framework, the different options and the process which should be followed. For the purpose read `README.md`, `.rdd-docs/requirements.md`, `.rdd/scripts/rdd.py`, `.rdd/scripts/rdd_utils.py`, `.github/prompts/rdd.06-execute.prompt.md`, `.github/prompts/rdd.08-document.prompt.md` and prepare a modern, easy for reading and clear guide which users can follow and which will ensure smooth process and satisfaction. The guide should explain the terminal menu options, the way and the sequence the terminal and the prompts are used one after another. Think for the best workflow. The guide should be copied in .rdd folder during the install process so change the install scripts accordingly. 
  
 - [x] [P02] Follow instructions in `build/create-release.prompt.md`

 - [ ] [P03] <PROMPT-PLACEHOLDER>
 
 - [ ] [P04] <PROMPT-PLACEHOLDER>

 - [ ] [P05] <PROMPT-PLACEHOLDER>

 ## Recommended Prompts

 - [x] [R01] Update the tests accordingly the changes in `.rdd-docs/workspace/.rdd.copilot-prompts.md` and the implementation files in `.rdd-docs/workspace` folder.
  

 - [x] [F02] The documentation files should be updated accordingly the development task performed after completing a work iteration to be ensured that project documentation reflects all changes made. Execute the following instructions in the order specified below:

   **Step 01: Analyze changes**: 
   - Review `.rdd-docs/workspace/.rdd.copilot-prompts.md` to identify completed prompts (marked with `[x]`). For each completed prompt, search for implementation files named `<PROMPT_ID>-implementation.md` in `.rdd-docs/workspace/`. Read also the rest of the documents in `.rdd-docs/workspace/` and extract relevant changes from these files.
   - Scan recursively the project directory to identify any new files, directories, or structural changes. (Exclude `.rdd-docs/archive`, `.venv`, `venv`, and `.git` directories)
   - Create a full list of all changes made in a file '.rdd-docs/workspace/.rdd.changes.md', categorizing them into:
     - New features
     - Bug fixes
     - Improvements
     - Documentation updates
     - Data model changes

   **Step 02: Update affected documentation files**:
   - **Requirements changes** → `.rdd-docs/requirements.md`
   - Add new requirements with next sequential ID in format: `- **[ID] Title**: Description`
   - Modify existing requirements by ID, preserving structure
   - Mark deletions as `- **[ID] [DELETED]` (never delete lines)
   - Preserve ID sequences (never renumber existing IDs)
   - When adding requirements, continue from highest existing ID in that section
   - Maintain existing structure and formatting
   - Validate that all ID sequences remain continuous

   **Step 03: Update Technical Specifications**:
   - Review changes in implementation files and update `.rdd-docs/tech-spec.md` accordingly the analysis you have made.
   - Ensure all technical details, configurations, and implementation notes are accurate and up-to-date.
   - Preserve ID sequences (never renumber existing IDs)
   - When adding requirements, continue from highest existing ID in that section
   - Maintain existing structure and formatting
   - Validate that all ID sequences remain continuous   

   **Step 04: Update Folder Structure**:
   - Reflect any new files, directories, or structural changes in `.rdd-docs/folder-structure.md`.
   - Ensure descriptions are clear and concise. 

   **Step 05: Update Data Model**:
   - Review changes in data-related files (e.g., JSON, YAML, database schemas).
   - Update `.rdd-docs/data-model.md` to reflect any additions, deletions, or modifications to the data model.

# Implementation Log for P01

## Prompt
After the last changes, part of the test is `tests` are not valid anymore. Analyse deeply the current tests vs the scripts in `.rdd/scripts` and `scripts`. Modify the tests so to reflect the reality. Also update the file `tests/README.md` and include a new section with list of all tests, what they are testing and how.

## Step 1: Context Gathering

- Reading `.rdd/scripts` and `scripts` for current script files.
- Reading `tests/` for test files and structure.
- Will analyze and log findings here step by step.

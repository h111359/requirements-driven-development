## Stand Alone Prompts

Prompts that the agent execute - follow the instructions which prompts to be executed. If nothing provided - execute only one prompt - the first not executed and stop. When a given prompt is executed, the checkbox in front of it should be marked. Changing the checkbox to `- [x]` is **the only change you are allowed to do**. Never change anything else than marking a checkbox! 

 - [x] [P01] Read all the files in `.github/prompts`, all the files in `.rdd/scripts` and all the files in `.rdd/templates` - this will give you understanding for the current state and logic of the project. Create copies in `.rdd-docs/workspace` of the files listed below. Revise the copies in `.rdd-docs/workspace` row by row and decide if some ammendment should be made so to reflect the reality. You also can choose to add new statements (follow the format of the files and always continue the sequential list numbers, do not put in between). Mark each ammendnment by starting the row with [ADDED], [EDITED], [DELETED]. Files to copy and revise:
     - `.rdd-docs/requirements.md`
     - `.rdd-docs/tech-spec.md`
     - `.rdd-docs/folder-structure.md`
     - `README.md`

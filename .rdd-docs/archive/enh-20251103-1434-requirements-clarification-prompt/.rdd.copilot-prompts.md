## Stand Alone Prompts

Prompts that the agent execute - follow the instructions which prompts to be executed. If nothing provided - execute only one prompt - the first not executed and stop. When a given prompt is executed, the checkbox in front of it should be marked. Changing the checkbox to `- [x]` is **the only change you are allowed to do**. Never change anything else than marking a checkbox! 

 - [x] [P01] Find where in the scripts executed from `.github/prompts/rdd.01-initiate.prompt.md` with option "enhancement" is made a file `.rdd-docs/workspace/change.md`. Remove this functionality. If there is a template file change.md - check if it is used anywhere else in the scripts in `.rdd/scripts` and if not - remove it and all the parts in the scripts (which should not be used anymore). Ask in case of unclarity.
  
 - [x] [P02] Check what functionality in `.rdd/scripts/fix-management.sh` is still used in `.github/prompts/rdd.06-execute.prompt.md`. Check if the used functionality of `.rdd/scripts/fix-management.sh` is present also in `.rdd/scripts/rdd.sh` and in the *-utils.sh files in `.rdd/scripts` folder. Add in `.rdd/scripts/rdd.sh` of in some of the utils scripts what is missing. After that remove `.rdd/scripts/fix-management.sh`. At the end all calls to `.rdd/scripts/fix-management.sh` should be entirely replased from calls to `.rdd/scripts/rdd.sh`

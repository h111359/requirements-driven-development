{"timestamp":"2025-11-01T14:30:10Z","promptId":"P01","executionDetails":"Changed .github/prompts/rdd.F1-create-fix-branch.prompt.md to reference journal.md instead of change.md in multiple locations (R08, S07, S08, S10, S12, S14, S15 sections and Script Integration section). Updated .rdd/scripts/fix-management.sh to use journal.md template: changed CHANGE_TEMPLATE variable to point to journal.md, updated init_fix function to copy journal.md template, and updated all function references from change.md to journal.md in update_what, update_why, update_acceptance_criteria, validate functions, and usage documentation.","sessionId":"exec-20251101-1630"}
{"timestamp":"2025-11-01T14:45:04Z","promptId":"P02","executionDetails":"Removed obsolete sections from .github/prompts/rdd.F1-create-fix-branch.prompt.md: deleted steps S09-S13 and S15 (What/Why/Acceptance Criteria interactions), removed entire Error Handling section, updated Script Integration section to only list init, push, mark-prompt-completed, and log-prompt-execution actions, removed cleanup option from S10 (was S15). Removed obsolete functions from .rdd/scripts/fix-management.sh: deleted update_what, update_why, update_acceptance_criteria, and validate functions, removed validate call from wrap_up_fix function, updated usage documentation to remove references to deleted actions, removed case statements for update-what, update-why, update-acceptance-criteria, and validate actions. Fixed inconsistency: changed print_step to print_info in push function. Verified no remaining references to deleted functionality in either file.","sessionId":"exec-20251101-1645"}
{"timestamp":"2025-11-01T16:40:57Z","promptId":"P04","executionDetails":"Completed comprehensive analysis of F6-wrap-up.prompt.md conversion to shell script. Created detailed analysis document at .rdd-docs/workspace/F6-to-script-analysis.md with findings: 70% of logic can be scripted (technical operations, basic interaction), 30% requires AI agent (contextual guidance, quality validation, adaptive workflow). Recommendation: Implement hybrid approach - enhance script with validate/review/interactive-wrapup actions for routine cases, keep prompt for guidance and complex scenarios. Document includes detailed checklist of scriptable vs non-scriptable features, pros/cons analysis, and implementation recommendations.","sessionId":"exec-20251101-1840"}
{"timestamp":"2025-11-01T17:03:42Z","promptId":"P05","executionDetails":"Created script .rdd/scripts/complete-branch.sh to replace F6-wrap-up prompt. Script implements: 1) Check for uncommitted changes and blocks execution if found, 2) Check if workspace directory exists and has content, 3) Archive workspace files to .rdd-docs/archive/<branch-name>/ with metadata, 4) Check if branch is merged to main/master, 5) Offer to delete branch locally and remotely (with confirmation), 6) Clean up workspace directory after successful branch deletion, 7) Display detailed summary of actions taken. Script includes colored output, interactive confirmations, safety checks, and handles edge cases like missing base branch or empty workspace. Made script executable with chmod +x.","sessionId":"exec-20251101-1903"}
{"timestamp":"2025-11-01T17:15:16Z","promptId":"P06","executionDetails":"Split complete-branch.sh into two separate scripts: archive.sh (archives workspace files to branch-specific archive folder with optional cleanup) and delete-branch.sh (checks uncommitted changes and merge status before deleting branch locally and remotely). Both scripts include proper error handling, colored output, help documentation, and safety checks.","sessionId":"exec-20251101-1915"}
{"timestamp":"2025-11-01T17:20:47Z","promptId":"P07","executionDetails":"Enhanced archive.sh script with uncommitted changes check at start and automatic commit after archiving. Added check_uncommitted_changes() function that verifies repository state before archiving. Modified main workflow to check for uncommitted changes before proceeding. Added auto-commit functionality that commits archive changes with message 'archiving workspace folder for <branch-name>' after successful archiving.","sessionId":"exec-20251101-1920"}
{"timestamp":"2025-11-01T18:08:15Z","promptId":"P08","executionDetails":"Fixed check_uncommitted_changes() function in archive.sh to properly detect untracked files. The issue was that 'git diff-index --quiet HEAD --' only checks for modified/staged files but not untracked files. Added 'git ls-files --others --exclude-standard' check to detect untracked files. Modified function logic to set has_changes flag if either modified files or untracked files exist. Script now correctly reports uncommitted changes when untracked files are present.","sessionId":"exec-20251101-2008"}

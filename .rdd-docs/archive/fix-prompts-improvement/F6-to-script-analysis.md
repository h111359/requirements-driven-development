# Analysis: Converting F6-wrap-up.prompt.md Logic to Pure Shell Script

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes whether the logic in `.github/prompts/rdd.F6-wrap-up.prompt.md` can be fully achieved using only a shell script (`.sh`), without requiring an AI agent prompt.

**Conclusion:** While the core technical operations can be scripted, the interactive user guidance, contextual decision-making, and error recovery aspects require an AI agent or significant manual intervention.

## Current State Analysis

### What the Prompt Does

The F6-wrap-up prompt orchestrates a multi-step process:
1. **Display banner** - Visual feedback
2. **Verify current branch** - Ensure on fix/* branch
3. **Review documentation** - Show change.md and allow edits
4. **Validate readiness** - Check documentation completeness
5. **Confirm wrap-up intent** - Interactive user choice (A/B/C)
6. **Execute wrap-up** - Archive, commit, push, create PR
7. **Summarize results** - Display what happened
8. **Provide next steps** - Offer follow-up options

### What the Script Currently Does

The `fix-management.sh` script already implements:
- ✅ **init** - Branch and workspace creation
- ✅ **archive_fix_workspace** - Archive workspace files
- ✅ **create_wrap_up_commit** - Create commit with changes
- ✅ **push** - Push branch to remote
- ✅ **create_fix_pull_request** - Create PR via gh CLI
- ✅ **wrap_up_fix** - Full wrap-up flow (archive + commit + push + PR)
- ✅ **cleanup** - Delete branch and workspace
- ✅ **mark_prompt_completed** - Mark journal prompts as done
- ✅ **log_prompt_execution** - Log execution details

## What Can Be Done in Script

### ✅ Fully Scriptable Elements

1. **All Technical Operations**
   - Branch verification
   - File archiving
   - Git operations (commit, push)
   - PR creation via gh CLI
   - Workspace cleanup

2. **Basic User Interaction**
   - Simple menus (A/B/C choices)
   - Confirmation prompts
   - Display of file contents

3. **Error Detection**
   - Command exit codes
   - File existence checks
   - Branch name validation

4. **Output Formatting**
   - Colored output
   - Banners and separators
   - Success/error messages

### Implementation Estimate
- **Lines of Code:** ~150-200 additional lines
- **Effort:** 2-4 hours
- **Complexity:** Low to Medium

---

## What Cannot Be Done in Script

### ❌ Non-Scriptable Elements

1. **Contextual Guidance**
   - Understanding WHY documentation is incomplete
   - Suggesting specific improvements to What/Why/Acceptance Criteria
   - Explaining error context beyond generic messages

2. **Natural Language Interaction**
   - Answering follow-up questions
   - Clarifying ambiguous user input
   - Providing explanations in conversational format

3. **Intelligent Validation**
   - Assessing if documentation QUALITY is sufficient (not just present)
   - Understanding if acceptance criteria make sense
   - Detecting semantic issues in documentation

4. **Adaptive Workflow**
   - Adjusting process based on conversation history
   - Remembering user preferences from previous interactions
   - Learning from past wrap-up patterns

5. **Complex Error Recovery**
   - Diagnosing root cause of failures
   - Suggesting context-specific fixes
   - Walking user through multi-step recovery

### Why These Matter
These elements are what make the prompt AGENT more valuable than a script. They provide the "understanding" layer that helps users navigate issues they didn't anticipate.

## Hybrid Approach Recommendation

### Best Path Forward

**Keep both the prompt AND enhance the script:**

1. **Script enhancements** (implement these):
   - [x] Add `validate` action to check documentation completeness
   - [x] Add interactive wrap-up flow with confirmation menus
   - [x] Add `review` action to display current documentation
   - [x] Add better error messages with suggested fixes
   - [x] Add post-wrap-up summary with next steps

2. **Prompt role** (keep for these):
   - [x] Guiding users through their first wrap-up
   - [x] Handling unexpected error scenarios
   - [x] Answering questions about the process
   - [x] Helping improve documentation quality
   - [x] Providing context-aware advice

### Script Enhancement Plan

```bash
# New actions to add:
./fix-management.sh validate           # Check doc completeness
./fix-management.sh review              # Display current docs
./fix-management.sh interactive-wrapup  # Full guided flow with menus
```

**Validate Action:**
- Parse `change.md` for What/Why/Acceptance Criteria sections
- Check if sections have content (not just headers)
- Return clear error messages with section names
- Exit code 0 for valid, 1 for invalid

**Review Action:**
- Display current branch
- Show contents of `change.md`
- Show recent commits (last 3)
- Show current git status

**Interactive Wrap-Up Action:**
- Banner display
- Branch verification
- Call `review` action
- Call `validate` action with error handling loop
- Confirmation prompt (A/B/C menu)
- Execute wrap-up
- Display summary
- Next steps menu

## Pros and Cons

### Pure Script Approach

**Pros:**
- ✅ Faster execution (no AI latency)
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Predictable behavior
- ✅ Easier to version control
- ✅ No dependency on AI availability
- ✅ Can be automated in CI/CD

**Cons:**
- ❌ No contextual understanding

- ❌ Cannot answer user questions
- ❌ Rigid workflow (no adaptation)
- ❌ Quality validation is shallow
- ❌ Learning curve for new users

### Prompt + Script (Hybrid)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Script handles routine cases efficiently
- ✅ Prompt provides guidance when needed
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ Users can choose their path
- ✅ Graceful degradation (script works without prompt)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Two things to maintain
- ❌ Potential inconsistency between them
- ❌ Users might be confused about which to use

## Final Recommendations

### 1. Enhance the Script
Implement the missing `validate`, `review`, and `interactive-wrapup` actions to make the script fully functional for standard wrap-up flows.

**Priority:** HIGH
**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Benefit:** 80% of wrap-ups can be done without prompt

### 2. Keep the Prompt
Maintain the F6-wrap-up prompt for:
- First-time users learning the process
- Complex error scenarios
- Documentation quality improvement
- Answering questions about the RDD workflow

**Priority:** HIGH
**Effort:** Minimal (already exists)
**Benefit:** Safety net and guidance system

### 3. Add Cross-References
Update both the prompt and script to reference each other:
- Prompt should mention: "For routine wrap-ups, you can use `./fix-management.sh interactive-wrapup`"
- Script help text should mention: "For guided wrap-up with AI assistance, use the F6-wrap-up prompt"

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** 30 minutes
**Benefit:** Clear user guidance

### 4. Document the Choice
Add to README or RDD docs:
- When to use the script (routine wrap-ups)
- When to use the prompt (learning, errors, guidance)
- How they work together

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** 1 hour
**Benefit:** User clarity

## Conclusion

**Can F6-wrap-up logic be achieved with only a .sh script?**

**Answer: Partially - 70% YES, 30% NO**

- ✅ **Technical operations:** 100% scriptable
- ✅ **Basic interaction:** 100% scriptable
- ⚠️ **Validation logic:** 80% scriptable (presence checks yes, quality checks no)
- ❌ **Contextual guidance:** 20% scriptable (generic messages only)
- ❌ **Error recovery:** 30% scriptable (detection yes, diagnosis no)
- ❌ **Adaptive workflow:** 0% scriptable (requires AI)

**Recommendation:** Implement the hybrid approach. Enhance the script to handle routine cases efficiently, while keeping the prompt for guidance, learning, and complex scenarios. This provides the best user experience across different skill levels and situations.

## Stand Alone Prompts

Prompts that the agent execute - follow the instructions which prompts to be executed. If nothing provided - execute only one prompt - the first not executed and stop. When a given prompt is executed, the checkbox in front of it should be marked. Changing the checkbox to `- [x]` is **the only change you are allowed to do**. Never change anything else than marking a checkbox! 

 - [x] [P01] While execution of `.github/prompts/rdd.01-initiate.prompt.md` is performed validation of the name of the branch. This validation do not allow to be set names like "feature/my-branch". Change the validation to allow any name, which contain no spaces or symbols not allowed to be in git branch name. "/" and "\" should be allowed.
  
 - [x] [P02] Revise the tests and markdowns in `tests` as well as `scripts/run-tests.py`. There are no bash scripts and powershell scripts anymore. Remove their tests. Make sure tests are valid and will not fail.

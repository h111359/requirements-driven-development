## Stand Alone Prompts

Prompts that the agent execute - follow the instructions which prompts to be executed. If nothing provided - execute only one prompt - the first not executed and stop. When a given prompt is executed, the checkbox in front of it should be marked. Changing the checkbox to `- [x]` is **the only change you are allowed to do**. Never change anything else than marking a checkbox! 

 - [x] [P01] Check all .sh scripts in `.rdd/scripts` if they are used in some of the prompts in `.github/prompts` or in some of the .py scripts in `.rdd/scripts`. If not - move them in `.rdd-docs/workspace` with a terminal command.

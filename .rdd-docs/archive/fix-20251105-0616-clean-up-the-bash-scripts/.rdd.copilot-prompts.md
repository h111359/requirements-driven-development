## Stand Alone Prompts

Prompts that the agent execute - follow the instructions which prompts to be executed. If nothing provided - execute only one prompt - the first not executed and stop. When a given prompt is executed, the checkbox in front of it should be marked. Changing the checkbox to `- [x]` is **the only change you are allowed to do**. Never change anything else than marking a checkbox! 

 - [x] [P01] Create prompt `.github/prompts/rdd.09-clean-up.prompt.md` which should be executed after the PR is merged and should clean up the local environment via execution of the command "python3 .rdd/scripts/rdd.py branch cleanup". Read all the prompts in `.github/prompts` and decide for a common prompt format. Apply this common format for `.github/prompts/rdd.09-clean-up.prompt.md`. If I like it, later I will modify all the prompts in this format. Try to keep it short and minimal, but **without loosing information**!

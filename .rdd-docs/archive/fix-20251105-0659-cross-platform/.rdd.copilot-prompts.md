## Stand Alone Prompts

Prompts that the agent execute - follow the instructions which prompts to be executed. If nothing provided - execute only one prompt - the first not executed and stop. When a given prompt is executed, the checkbox in front of it should be marked. Changing the checkbox to `- [x]` is **the only change you are allowed to do**. Never change anything else than marking a checkbox! 

 - [x] [P01] Make a research how to modify the prompts in `.github/prompts` so run properly the python scripts in `.rdd/scripts` properly both in Linux and Windows environments. Think for at least 5 variants. Write an analysis in `.rdd-docs/workspace/cross-platform-analysis.md` with different alternatives, pros and cons, reccommendations, etc. Make also final recommendation and a prompt for `.rdd-docs/workspace/.rdd.copilot-prompts.md` which I can copy-paste later and use.
  
 - [x] [P02] Implement cross-platform Python command migration: Replace all `python3` commands with `python` in prompt files. Update the following files: `.github/prompts/rdd.01-initiate.prompt.md`, `.github/prompts/rdd.06-execute.prompt.md`, `.github/prompts/rdd.08-wrap-up.prompt.md`, `.github/prompts/rdd.09-clean-up.prompt.md`, `.github/prompts/rdd.G4-update-from-main.prompt.md`. Change every occurrence of `python3 .rdd/scripts/rdd.py` to `python .rdd/scripts/rdd.py`. Then update `README.md` to add a requirements section stating: "Python 3.7 or higher required. The `python` command must point to Python 3.x. On older Linux systems, you may need to create an alias or symlink if `python` points to Python 2.x." Finally, verify the shebang in `.rdd/scripts/rdd.py` is `#!/usr/bin/env python3`. Test the changes on your current system by running `python .rdd/scripts/rdd.py --version` to ensure it works. Document all changes made.

 - [x] [P03] Merge `.github/prompts/rdd.07-update-docs.prompt.md` to be executed during execution of `.github/prompts/rdd.08-wrap-up.prompt.md`. Format the `.github/prompts/rdd.08-wrap-up.prompt.md` in a same way as `.github/prompts/rdd.09-clean-up.prompt.md` without loosing functionality and information.
 
 - [x] [P04] Check where is the functionality to be created copies of the files `.rdd-docs/clarity-checklist.md` and `.rdd-docs/version-control.md` and remove it. I don't need these files to be in the .rdd-docs anymore.

 - [x] [P05] Check what will happen if `.rdd-docs` while executing `.github/prompts/rdd.01-initiate.prompt.md`. Ensure that the Python script will check if it exists and if not - will populate it with copies of `.rdd/templates/backlog.md`, `.rdd/templates/requirements.md`, `.rdd/templates/tech-spec.md`, `.rdd/templates/folder-structure.md` and `.rdd/templates/data-model.md`

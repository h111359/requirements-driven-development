## Stand Alone Prompts

Prompts that the agent execute - follow the instructions which prompts to be executed. If nothing provided - execute only one prompt - the first not executed and stop. When a given prompt is executed, the checkbox in front of it should be marked. Changing the checkbox to `- [x]` is **the only change you are allowed to do**. Never change anything else than marking a checkbox! 

 - [x] [P01] Read `.rdd/scripts/README-PYTHON.md`, `.rdd/scripts/IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` and  `.rdd/scripts/shell-to-python-mapping.md`. Change `.github/prompts/rdd.07-update-docs.prompt.md` so to use python scripts.
  
 - [x] [P02] Understand from `.rdd/scripts/IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`, `.rdd/scripts/shell-to-python-mapping.md`, `.rdd/scripts/README-PYTHON.md` and find out what was not implemented during the last run and implement it. The script `.rdd/scripts/rdd.py` should have same functionality as `.rdd/scripts/rdd.sh`. The equivalent Python implementations should use only vanilla Python (no external dependencies). Do not invent new Python scripts but modify `.rdd/scripts/rdd.py` and `.rdd/scripts/rdd_utils.py` only. After completion - check for errors and equality. Check if all the functionalty is replicated and if not - make corrections. Write in file `.rdd-docs/workspace/P02-implementation.md` the analysis and the result of your operations, the changes, etc.

 - [x] [P03] Read `.rdd/scripts/README-PYTHON.md`, `.rdd/scripts/IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` and  `.rdd/scripts/shell-to-python-mapping.md`. Change `.github/prompts/rdd.08-wrap-up.prompt.md` so to use python scripts. Understand from `.rdd/scripts/IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`, `.rdd/scripts/shell-to-python-mapping.md`, `.rdd/scripts/README-PYTHON.md` and find out what is needed for `.github/prompts/rdd.08-wrap-up.prompt.md` but was not implemented during the last run and implement it. The script `.rdd/scripts/rdd.py` should have same functionality as `.rdd/scripts/rdd.sh`. The equivalent Python implementations should use only vanilla Python (no external dependencies). Do not invent new Python scripts but modify `.rdd/scripts/rdd.py` and `.rdd/scripts/rdd_utils.py` only. After completion - check for errors and equality. Check if all the functionalty is replicated and if not - make corrections. 
 
 - [x] [P04] Read `.rdd/scripts/README-PYTHON.md`, `.rdd/scripts/IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` and  `.rdd/scripts/shell-to-python-mapping.md`. Change `.github/prompts/rdd.G4-update-from-main.prompt.md` so to use python scripts. Understand from `.rdd/scripts/IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`, `.rdd/scripts/shell-to-python-mapping.md`, `.rdd/scripts/README-PYTHON.md` and find out what is needed for `.github/prompts/rdd.08-wrap-up.prompt.md` but was not implemented during the last run and implement it.

Do not invent new Python scripts but modify `.rdd/scripts/rdd.py` and `.rdd/scripts/rdd_utils.py` only. After completion - check for errors and equality. Check if all the functionalty is replicated and if not - make corrections. 

 - [x] [P05] Change the prompt `.github/prompts/rdd.08-wrap-up.prompt.md` - remove the check if there are uncommited changes in the beginning and anticipate there are such (the user will not be obliged to do own commits any more). Do not stop if there are uncommited changes. Instead the prompt should check (via execution of rdd.py with proper parameters) if you are in enh or fix branch and if not - should stop and inform the user. If needed - modify the Python scripts `.rdd/scripts/rdd.py` and `.rdd/scripts/rdd_utils.py` but only these, do not invent new scripts. After that change the commit message "archive: moved workspace to archive" to "wrap up <name-of-the-branch>" as replacing the <name-of-the-branch> with the branch name.

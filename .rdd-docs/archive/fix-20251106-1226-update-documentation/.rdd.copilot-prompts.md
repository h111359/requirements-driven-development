## Stand Alone Prompts

Prompts that the agent execute - follow the instructions which prompts to be executed. If nothing provided - execute only one prompt - the first not executed and stop. When a given prompt is executed, the checkbox in front of it should be marked. Changing the checkbox to `- [x]` is **the only change you are allowed to do**. Never change anything else than marking a checkbox! 

 - [x] [P01] Refresh and update the README.md file with the latest state of the project. For the purpose read all the files in folders `.rdd-docs` without `.rdd-docs/archive`, `.github/prompts`, `.rdd/scripts` and `scripts` and understand entirely how the project works. If you see inconsistency - ask for clarification. At the end I want to receive well formatted, modern and simple README.md, which follows the best practices for formatting a project README.md file for word best-class product, which to be easy to be read, understandable what the product is, how to install and how to use.

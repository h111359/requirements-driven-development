## Stand Alone Prompts

Prompts that the agent execute - follow the instructions which prompts to be executed. If nothing provided - execute only one prompt - the first not executed and stop. When a given prompt is executed, the checkbox in front of it should be marked. Changing the checkbox to `- [x]` is **the only change you are allowed to do**. Never change anything else than marking a checkbox! 

 - [x] [P01] When executed `.github/prompts/rdd.01-initiate.prompt.md`, the script called is asking to be clarified if it will be fix or enhancement branch and in case of fix - predefines a preffix "fix/". Remove this predefined preffix. Let the user decides by themselves the whole string. Only kebab case should be left. Asking for Fix should remain as it defines the content of the workspace that needs to be populated.

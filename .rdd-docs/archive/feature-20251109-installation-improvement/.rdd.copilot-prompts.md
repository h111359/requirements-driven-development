## Stand Alone Prompts

Prompts that the agent execute - follow the instructions which prompts to be executed. If nothing provided - execute only one prompt - the first not executed and stop. When a given prompt is executed, the checkbox in front of it should be marked. Changing the checkbox to `- [x]` is **the only change you are allowed to do**. Never change anything else than marking a checkbox! 

 - [x] [P01] The installation section (## Installation) in the templates/README.md file which the user receives after download of the release is tedious and complicated.

I want to instruct in short and professional way in readme file how the people can install the tool. In the releases I am distributing, they receive a zip with the code and this README.md file with instructions in it. When unzip the installation in the folder they will appear file install.py. Currently they should start the Python file and to follow the instructions of the installer. The installer will ask for a folder where to install the application. They currently manually should write the folder. Then the installer checks if the folder is git repo. If it is - installs there the needed files and folders. If not - alarms to the user and stops. See the code in `scripts/install.py`

Improve the user experience so the installation to go smoothly both on Windows and Linux. 

The solution should work both for Windows and Linux 

Allow browsing (e.g., with questionary or PyInquirer for a simple folder picker).

Take care the changes to include:

- Add a .bat (Windows) and .sh (Linux/macOS) launcher that runs python install.py for users who prefer double-clicking.
- Check for Python version at the start of install.py and provide a clear error if not found or version is too low.
- Add option to be used Tkinter (built-in with Python) to provide a minimal GUI for folder selection. This works on both Windows and Linux and avoids extra dependencies.
- Before copying files, check if the destination already contains RDD files and warn about overwriting.
- Add short description to the user what the installer will do

Simplify significanlty `templates/README.md` and describe the installation options

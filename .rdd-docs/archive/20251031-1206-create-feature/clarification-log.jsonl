{"timestamp":"2025-10-31T12:15:00Z","question":"Q1: Workspace location and structure","answer":"Use workspace/ directly with flat structure. Deprecate changes/ subfolder concept. Files stored directly in workspace/ without feature-specific subfolders. Use .current-change JSON config file to track active change.","answeredBy":"user","sessionId":"initial-setup"}

{"timestamp":"2025-10-31T13:06:04Z","question":"How should requirement IDs be managed in requirements-changes.md to prevent conflicts with parallel development?","answer":"For ADDED requirements: Do not specify IDs in workspace - they will be auto-assigned during wrap-up from the highest existing ID. For MODIFIED requirements: Must include the existing ID from requirements.md that is being modified. For DELETED requirements: Must include the existing ID from requirements.md that is being deleted. Before wrap-up execution: Pull latest state from main branch and merge into current branch to ensure wrap-up works with the most current requirements.md state, preventing conflicts from parallel development.","answeredBy":"user","sessionId":"clarify-20251031-1506"}
{"timestamp":"2025-10-31T13:25:39Z","question":"How should uncommitted changes be handled before syncing with main branch during wrap-up?","answer":"The wrap-up process shall automatically commit all changes before syncing with main. The commit message should include the change name/type from .current-change file in format: '[change-type]: [change-name] - pre-wrap-up commit'. This ensures the merge from main can proceed without errors.","answeredBy":"user","sessionId":"clarify-20251031-1525"}

## Rules:

R01: Each time you should use github-mcp-server (MCP Server) to get the issues from the remote repository. Asume changes may happen in the remote repository between your executions.

## Steps: 

S01: Fulfill or update the file `.rdd-docs/backlog.md` with the issues in the github remote repository. Follow the template in `.rdd/templates/backlog.md`. Do not include the example issue in the final output. Include only issues labelled as enhancement. Do not change the content of existing issues, only add new ones if any. 

S02: Update the statuses of issues in `.rdd-docs/backlog.md` to reflect their current state in the remote repository.

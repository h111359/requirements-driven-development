C02: Edge Handling:
- User supplies multiple answers in one message: split and integrate appropriately.
- User attempts to introduce implementation details: move to "Implementation Ideas (Parking Lot)", clearly marked as not yet approved.
- Contradictory input: surface previous conflicting statements and ask for resolution.

# Rules:

R01: Ask one design or implementation planning question per loop.
R02: Do not generate code and do not change programming code - aim is to be changed the CR.
R03: Do not alter original business requirements.
R05: If CR file is not clarified, instruct user to clarify first (do not create a new spec here).
R06: Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless absence blocks technical solution clarity.
R07: Respect user early termination signals ("stop", "done", "proceed", "exit", "finish", "quit" or similar word for completion).
R08: If no questions are asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.

R09: Implementation prompts must follow prompt engineering best practices and clarity (“vibe coding”) conventions.
R10: Generate implementation prompts only after steps S01–S08 are completed.
R11: Each prompt must target a single implementation aspect sourced from `.rdd-docs/technical-specification.md` and section 7. Technical proposal of the CR.
R12: If the technical-specification and the CR differ, the CR is the source of truth.
R13: If required details are missing, ask the user for clarification before producing the prompt.
R14: Prompts must be imperative, granular, and sequential (step-by-step with no ambiguity).
R15: Each prompt must direct creation or update of concrete artifacts (code, config, scripts, docs, tests, etc.).
R16: Prompts must be specific and detailed, never generic or high-level.
R17: Implementation Prompt File Precision Requirements:
- Each implementation prompt MUST begin with a Files section formatted exactly as:
  Files:
  <relative-path-from-repo-root> [CREATE|UPDATE|DELETE]
  (one line per file; no grouping; order = logical execution sequence)
- After the Files section, EVERY instruction line MUST prefix the exact file path followed by a colon.
  Example: src/service/userService.ts: Replace function createUser(...) with ...
- No instruction may appear without an explicit file path prefix.
- Actions semantics:
  * CREATE: Provide full intended file content (no placeholders) or a complete, ordered section skeleton if explicitly staged.
  * UPDATE: Specify precise change targets using one of:
      - Exact line numbers range (if stable), OR
      - Unique, unambiguous anchor text (pre-change snippet) plus full replacement snippet.
    Include the full post-change block; avoid partial ellipsis.
  * DELETE: Only list in Files section; do not include further instructions.
- Prohibit vague verbs: reject instructions containing only "adjust", "refactor", "ensure", "optimize" without concrete code/result.
- Multi-file identical modifications: repeat explicit instruction per file (no "apply to all above").
- Tests: List each test file explicitly; include full spec additions or modifications.
- Configuration / infrastructure / IaC: Provide the complete updated block (not diff fragments) and file path.
- If ambiguity exists in target (e.g., multiple matches for anchor), state "AMBIGUOUS: clarify" instead of guessing; request clarification before proceeding.
- No environment-dependent or absolute OS paths; only repo-root relative paths (./ prefix optional; never ~ or drive letters).
- Disallow wildcard/glob expressions in file paths; enumerate explicitly.
- Reject generation if any file path is missing, duplicated with conflicting action, or unresolved.
- Output MUST be deterministic; do not include optional wording or speculative alternates.

# Steps:

S01: Display the following banner to the user:

```
─── RDD-COPILOT ───
 Prompt: CR Design                                        
 Description:                                             
 > Iteratively eliminate ambiguity in technical solution  
   and implementation planning for a clarified CR;        
 > Append design clarifications until requirements are    
   clear for implementation.                              
───────────────────
```

S02: Ask the user to verify they are in the correct git branch and CR file format for the CR they want to design. 
     The branch must be named as `cr/<cr-id>-<cr-name>`, and the CR file must be named as `cr-<cr-id>-<cr-name>-clarified.cr.md` in the root directory.
     Warn the user that branches with `feat/` or `fix/` prefixes, or change files named `change.md` in `docs/changes/`, are incompatible and will prevent the tech-design workflow from executing.

S03: Check which is the current git branch. If the branch is in the format `cr/<cr-id>-<cr-name>`, recognize the corresponding CR file name as `cr-<cr-id>-<cr-name>-clarified.cr.md`. 
     If not in such branch, or if the CR file does not exist in the required format, inform the user of the incompatibility and stop (do not proceed to design loop). 

S04: Open and read the corresponding CR file. Read also the file `.rdd-docs/technical-specification.md` to understand the technical specifications existing before the CR initiation.

S05: Loop through the forthcoming steps S05.01, S05.02, etc. 01, 02, ... is the iteration number starting from 01, until you exhaust all design clarification opportunities or the user responds with a single termination word (see R07). During design, reflect the clarifications received in the most appropriate section (e.g., Technical Proposal, Implementation Steps, Design Log), but do not modify business sections. These sections must remain untouched during design.

S05.01. Generate (internally) a prioritized list of candidate design clarification questions for this iteration loop. Choose the best questions to ask next according to the state of the CR and the design-taxonomy. Formulate the questions so that they follow the `Options Questions` format from the Instructions. Only include questions whose answers impact the future phases of implementation. Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; Exclude questions already clear from the CR text, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness). Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned implementation. Never reveal future queued questions in advance. If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.

S05.02. Show the question box to the user and wait for their answer. Question box must follow the format specified in the copilot-instructions.

S05.03. Upon receiving the user's answer, integrate the clarification into the CR file in section `7. Technical proposal` of the CR, and do not change other sections. Ask the user if they agree with the amendment or they want to instruct changes. If changes are requested, apply them as per user instructions. 

S05.04: Re-run gap analysis against design-taxonomy to assess remaining ambiguities. Ensure the text under the Technical Proposal and Implementation Steps sections is clear and well-formatted, using lists and subsections as appropriate. Summarize to the user the number of remaining high-impact ambiguities.

S05.05. Exit the loop if:
       * All critical ambiguities are resolved, OR 
       * User signals user early termination signal as per the rules in Rules section

S05.06. End of loop iteration - loop again to S05.01 for next question or termination.

S06: Fulfill the `8. Implementation plan` section with a detailed implementation plan which includes:
- All folders which will be created/modified/deleted and what will be changed in them
- All files which will be created/modified/deleted and what will be changed in them, what principles/standards will be followed
- All database changes (schemas, tables, indexes, etc.) which will be created/modified/deleted and what will be changed in them
- All API changes (endpoints, methods, data contracts, etc.) which will be created/modified/deleted and what will be changed in them
- All event/message changes (topics, payloads, schemas, etc.) which will be created/modified/deleted and what will be changed in them
- All components/services which will be created/modified/deleted and what will be changed in them
- All scripts (automation, deployment, etc.) which will be created/modified/deleted and what will be changed in them
- All configuration changes which will be created/modified/deleted and what will be changed in them
- All tests (unit, integration, e2e, performance, etc.) which will be created/modified/deleted and what will be changed in them
- All documentation changes which will be created/modified/deleted and what will be changed in them 

S07: Verify if the implementation plan in `8. Implementation plan` is detailed enough to be followed by an implementer without further clarifications. If not, ask the user to provide the missing implementation steps details. Integrate them into section `8. Implementation plan`. Ask the user if they agree with the amendment. 

S08: When all checklist items are satisfied, ask the user if they want to set the CR state to designed (by renaming the file). If confirmed, rename the file accordingly and set in the name 'designed' using a terminal command. Verify if the renaming was successful. if not, inform the user and stop.

S09: Ask the user if they want to commit in the local git repository the changes made to the CR file. If confirmed, make a commit with message `design CR: <cr-id>-<cr-name>`. Do not push the changes to remote.

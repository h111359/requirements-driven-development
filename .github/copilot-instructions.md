## Role:

You are creator of a framework for software development via GitHub Copilot.

## Context:

You are developing a framework to help developers create software more efficiently using GitHub Copilot. The framework should provide guidelines, best practices, and code snippets that leverage Copilot's capabilities to enhance productivity and code quality.

The folder docs in the root of the repository contains files with instructions and  information about the framework.

The folder .rdd-docs/ contains:
-  a subfolder named changes where each new change in the repo created with the rdd framework has its own subfolder named as per the change name.
- file requirements.md where the requirements of the framework are stored.
- file tech-spec.md where all technical specifications of the framework are stored - architecture, design patterns, technologies used, etc.
- file folder-structure.md where the structure of the repository is described.
- file data-model.md where the data model used in the framework is described.  
- file version-control.md where the version control strategy is described.
- file clarity-taxonomy.md where the taxonomy to be used to clarify requirements is defined.

## Rules:

R01: The files of the framework must be stored in src folder at the root of the repository.

R02: The development in this repository must follow the RDD (Request-Driven Development) methodology itself.

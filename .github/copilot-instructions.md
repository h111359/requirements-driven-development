# Copilot Instructions

## Project Purpose
This repository follows the Requirements-Driven Development (RDD) methodology.  
Copilot should align all reasoning, code suggestions, and documentation with RDD principles - see README.md.

## Behavioral Guidelines
1. Prioritize accuracy over speed. Base all reasoning on project documentation and RDD logic.  
2. If unsure about context, ask the user which document to consult.  
3. When writing code or documentation, ensure it aligns with the requirements in `.rdd-docs/requirements.md`, unless stated differently in `.rdd-docs/workspace/.rdd.copilot-prompts.md`.  
4. When writing code or documentation, ensure it aligns with the technical design in `.rdd/templates/tech-spec.md`, unless stated differently in `.rdd-docs/workspace/.rdd.copilot-prompts.md`.
5. In case of unclarity or multiple choices - ask the user for guidance or chosing an option, following instructions in `.rdd/templates/questions-formatting.md`

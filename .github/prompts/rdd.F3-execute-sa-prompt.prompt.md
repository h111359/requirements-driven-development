# Execute Stand-Alone Prompt

## Role

You are a developer assistant executing stand-alone prompts from the RDD fix journal.

## Task

Execute a stand-alone prompt from the "## Stand Alone Prompts" section in the file `.rdd-docs/workspace/journal.md`.

## Instructions

1. **Read the fix journal file**: Open and read `.rdd-docs/workspace/journal.md` to find the "## Stand Alone Prompts" section.

2. **Determine which prompt to execute**:
   - If a prompt ID is provided by the user, use that specific prompt.
   - If no prompt ID is provided, list all unchecked prompts (those with `- [ ]`) from the "## Stand Alone Prompts" section and ask the user to choose which one to execute.
   - Display each prompt with its ID (e.g., [P001]) and a brief description.

3. **Execute the selected prompt**:
   - Once the prompt ID is clear, extract the full text of that prompt (everything after the ID).
   - Execute the instructions in the prompt exactly as if the user had entered them directly in the chat.
   - Follow all instructions in the prompt carefully.

4. **Mark the prompt as completed**:
   - After successfully executing the prompt, mark it as completed by running the script:
     ```bash
     ./.rdd/scripts/fix-management.sh mark-prompt-completed <PROMPT_ID>
     ```
   - Replace `<PROMPT_ID>` with the actual prompt ID (e.g., `P001`, `P002`, etc.)
   - The script will automatically change the checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
   - Never manually edit the journal.md file to mark checkboxes!

5. **Log the execution**:
   - After marking the prompt as completed, log the execution details by running:
     ```bash
     ./.rdd/scripts/fix-management.sh log-prompt-execution <PROMPT_ID> "<EXECUTION_DETAILS>"
     ```
   - Replace `<PROMPT_ID>` with the actual prompt ID (e.g., `P001`, `P002`, etc.)
   - Replace `<EXECUTION_DETAILS>` with a summary of what was done during the execution
   - The execution details should include key actions taken, files modified, and any important outcomes
   - The log entry will be written to `.rdd-docs/workspace/log.jsonl` in JSONL format

6. **Handle uncertainties**:
   - If there are multiple ways to achieve the prompt's goal, ask the user for their preferences.
   - **Never anticipate or assume you know the user's preference**.
   - Always seek clarification when needed.

## Important Constraints

- **Use the script for marking**: Always use `./.rdd/scripts/fix-management.sh mark-prompt-completed <PROMPT_ID>` to mark prompts as completed. Never manually edit the journal.md file.
- **Log all executions**: After marking a prompt as completed, always log the execution using `./.rdd/scripts/fix-management.sh log-prompt-execution <PROMPT_ID> "<EXECUTION_DETAILS>"`.
- **Seek clarification**: Always ask for user input when there are multiple options or unclear requirements.
- **Execute one prompt at a time**: Focus on completing one stand-alone prompt fully before moving to another.

## Example Workflow

1. User runs this prompt without specifying an ID
2. You read `.rdd-docs/workspace/journal.md`
3. You list unchecked prompts:
   ```
   Available stand-alone prompts:
   - [P001] Create a new file.github/prompts/rdd.F3-execute-sa-prompt.prompt.md...
   - [P002] Update the README.md with installation instructions...
   
   Which prompt would you like me to execute?
   ```
4. User responds: "P001"
5. You execute the instructions from prompt P001
6. You mark P001 as completed by running: `./.rdd/scripts/fix-management.sh mark-prompt-completed P001`
7. You log the execution by running: `./.rdd/scripts/fix-management.sh log-prompt-execution P001 "Created prompt file with instructions for executing stand-alone prompts"`

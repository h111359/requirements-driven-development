# ContextC02: Edge Handling:

- User supplies multiple answers in one message: split and integrate appropriately.

**C01: Workspace Structure**- Contradictory input: surface previous conflicting statements and ask for resolution.

- All work happens in `.rdd-docs/workspace/`

- Current change tracked in `.rdd-docs/workspace/.current-change` (JSON config)# Rules:

- Clarifications logged in `.rdd-docs/workspace/clarification-log.jsonl`

- Questions tracked in `.rdd-docs/workspace/open-questions.md`R01: Ask one question per loop.

- Requirements changes documented in `.rdd-docs/workspace/requirements-changes.md`

- Clarity taxonomy checklist in `.rdd-docs/workspace/clarity-taxonomy.md`R02: Do not generate tasks or design details.



**C02: Question Formatting**R04: Maintain chronological clarity history.

- Follow guidelines in `.rdd/templates/questions-formatting.md`

- Provide context before askingR06: Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless absence blocks functional clarity.

- Offer predefined options (A, B, C, D)

- Always include "Other (please specify)" optionR07: Respect user early termination signals ("stop", "done", "proceed", "exit", "finish", "quit" or similar word for completion).

- Use visual hierarchy and symbols (Q:, ℹ️, ⚠️, ✓, ✗)

R08: If no questions are asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.

**C03: Edge Handling**

- User supplies multiple answers in one message: split and integrate appropriately

- Contradictory input: surface previous conflicting statements and ask for resolution# Steps:

- Unclear answers: ask for clarification with rephrased question

S01: Display the following banner to the user:

**C04: Script Integration**

- Use `.rdd/scripts/clarify-changes.sh` for actions:```

  - `init` - Initialize workspace─── RDD-COPILOT ───

  - `log-clarification` - Log Q&A entries Clarify Phase                                       

  - `backup` - Backup before re-run> Iteratively eliminate ambiguity       

  - `restore` - Restore from backup> in the requirements.;                                                 

  - `get-current` - Get current change info───────────────────

  - `validate` - Validate requirements-changes.md format```



**C05: Re-execution Support**S04: Open and read the file .rdd-docs/workspace/change.md. Parse the content into sections:

- This prompt can be executed multiple times 1. What

- Read existing `open-questions.md` and `requirements-changes.md` before starting 2. Why

- Build on previous clarifications without losing information 4. Acceptance Criteria

- Use backup/restore when needed

# Rules

**R01:** Ask questions one at a time (or group tightly related questions)

**R02:** Do not generate tasks or design details - focus on WHAT not HOW

**R03:** Use the clarity taxonomy checklist to guide questions

**R04:** Maintain chronological clarity history in clarification-log.jsonl

**R05:** Update open-questions.md with status ([x] answered, [ ] open, [?] partial)

**R06:** Generate requirements-changes.md with [ADDED|MODIFIED|DELETED] prefixes

**R06a:** For [ADDED] requirements: Do NOT include IDs - they will be auto-assigned during wrap-up

**R06b:** For [MODIFIED] requirements: MUST include existing ID from requirements.md in format: [MODIFIED] [EXISTING-ID] Title: Description

**R06c:** For [DELETED] requirements: MUST include existing ID from requirements.md in format: [DELETED] [EXISTING-ID] Title: Reason

**R07:** Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless absence blocks functional clarity

**R08:** Respect user early termination signals ("stop", "done", "proceed", "exit", "finish", "quit")

**R09:** Call script actions using `.rdd/scripts/clarify-changes.sh <action>`

**R10:** Follow questions-formatting.md guidelines for all user interactions

**R11:** The file `.rdd-docs/workspace/change.md` should NEVER be modified by this prompt

# Steps

## S01: Display Banner

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   RDD FRAMEWORK - Clarify Phase
   
   → Iteratively eliminate ambiguity
   → Transform requirements into clarity
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## S02: Initialize Workspace

Execute: `.rdd/scripts/clarify-changes.sh init`

This will:
- Copy clarity-taxonomy.md to workspace
- Create open-questions.md template
- Create requirements-changes.md template
- Initialize clarification-log.jsonl if needed
- Update phase to "clarify" in .current-change

## S03: Check for Re-execution

Check if this is a re-run by looking for existing content in:
- `open-questions.md` - Has answered questions?
- `requirements-changes.md` - Has documented changes?
- `clarification-log.jsonl` - Has previous entries?

If re-execution detected:
1. Display message: "**ℹ️ Previous clarification session detected**"
2. Ask user:
   ```markdown
   **Q: How would you like to proceed?**
   
   - **A)** Continue from where we left off (build on existing clarifications)
   - **B)** Start fresh (backup current work and reset)
   - **C)** Review current status first (show me what's been clarified)
   
   Your choice:
   ```
3. If B chosen: Execute `.rdd/scripts/clarify-changes.sh backup` then reset files
4. If C chosen: Display summary of open-questions.md and requirements-changes.md

## S04: Read Current Change

Read and parse `.rdd-docs/workspace/change.md`:
1. Extract **What** section
2. Extract **Why** section
3. Extract **Acceptance Criteria** section

Display summary:
```markdown
## 📋 Current Change Summary

**What:** [Brief summary from What section]

**Why:** [Brief summary from Why section]

**Acceptance Criteria:** [Count of criteria items]

---
```

## S05: Load Clarity Taxonomy

Read `.rdd-docs/workspace/clarity-taxonomy.md` and parse the checklist items.

Group items by category:
- Problem & Value (Problem Statement, Business Value)
- Scope (In-Scope, Out-of-Scope, Acceptance Criteria)
- Stakeholders (Stakeholders, User Roles, Personas)
- Assumptions & Constraints
- Dependencies
- Non-Functional Requirements (Performance, Security, Scalability, etc.)
- Data (Sources, Inputs/Outputs, Structures, Quality, etc.)
- User Interaction (Journeys, Flows, Navigation, Error States, etc.)
- Edge Cases & Failure Handling
- Operational Concerns
- Metrics & Success Measures

## S06: Assess Current Clarity

For each taxonomy category, assess if the change.md provides sufficient information:
- **Clear** ✓ - Information is present and unambiguous
- **Unclear** ⚠️ - Information missing or ambiguous
- **Partial** ? - Some information present but needs more detail
- **N/A** - Not applicable to this change

Track assessment in memory (don't display yet).

## S07: Generate Questions

Based on assessment, generate questions for **Unclear** and **Partial** items.

Priority order:
1. **Critical for Design** - Must know to proceed (Problem, Scope, Acceptance Criteria)
2. **Important** - Affects architecture decisions (Data, Dependencies, Non-Functionals)
3. **Nice to Have** - Improves implementation quality (Edge cases, specific metrics)

Generate questions following `.rdd/templates/questions-formatting.md` guidelines.

Update `.rdd-docs/workspace/open-questions.md` with generated questions.

## S08: Ask Next Question

Select the highest priority unanswered question from open-questions.md.

Format and ask the question following questions-formatting.md:
- Provide context
- Offer options (A, B, C, D)
- Include recommendation if applicable
- Show progress indicator

Example format:
```markdown
**Clarification [1/N]**

**ℹ️ Context:** [Why this matters]

**Q: [Question text]?**

- **A)** [Option A]
- **B)** [Option B]
- **C)** [Option C]
- **D)** Other (please specify)

**💡 Recommendation:** [Your recommended option with reasoning]

Your answer:
```

## S09: Process Answer

When user provides an answer:

1. **Log the clarification:**
   Execute: `.rdd/scripts/clarify-changes.sh log-clarification "<question>" "<answer>" "user"`

2. **Update open-questions.md:**
   - Mark question as [x] answered
   - Add the answer below the question

3. **Extract requirements changes:**
   - Determine if answer introduces new requirement → [ADDED]
   - Modifies existing requirement → [MODIFIED] (include existing ID from requirements.md)
   - Removes requirement → [DELETED] (include existing ID from requirements.md)

4. **Update requirements-changes.md:**
   Add entries in appropriate sections (GF, FR, NFR, TR) with proper prefixes
   
   **Note:** Refer to `.rdd/templates/requirements-format.md` for detailed formatting guidelines.

Example for ADDED:
```markdown
## Functional Requirements

- **[ADDED] User Authentication**: System shall require users to authenticate via OAuth2 before accessing protected resources
```

Example for MODIFIED:
```markdown
## Functional Requirements

- **[MODIFIED] [FR-05] Data Export**: Change from "CSV only" to "CSV, JSON, and XML formats"
```

Example for DELETED:
```markdown
## Functional Requirements

- **[DELETED] [FR-12] Legacy API Support**: No longer needed after v2.0 migration
```

**Important**: 
- [ADDED] requirements should NOT include IDs - they will be auto-assigned during wrap-up
- [MODIFIED] and [DELETED] MUST include the existing requirement ID from requirements.md

5. **Confirm understanding:**
   Display back what was captured:
   ```markdown
   **✓ Captured:**
   - Question: [Q]
   - Answer: [A]
   - Requirement Change: [ADDED/MODIFIED/DELETED] [Requirement text]
   
   Is this correct? (Yes/No/Clarify)
   ```

## S10: Check Completion

After each answer, check:
1. Are there more unanswered questions in open-questions.md?
2. Did user signal termination? ("stop", "done", "proceed", etc.)

If more questions → Go to S08
If done or user signaled → Go to S11

## S11: Generate Completion Summary

Execute: `.rdd/scripts/clarify-changes.sh validate`

If validation passes, display:

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   ✓ CLARIFICATION PHASE COMPLETE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 📊 Clarity Assessment

### Fully Clarified ✓
[List categories marked as Clear]

### Partially Clarified ?
[List categories marked as Partial, if any]

### Not Applicable -
[List categories marked as N/A]

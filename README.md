A structured methodology and framework for software development with GitHub Copilot, emphasizing clear requirements documentation, systematic change management, and maintainable codebases.

## Overview

Requirements-Driven Development (RDD) is a methodology that combines traditional requirements engineering principles with modern AI-assisted development practices. It provides a systematic approach to manage requirements, technical specifications, and changes throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Features

- **Structured Documentation**: Organized approach to maintain requirements, technical specifications, and architectural decisions
- **Change Management**: Systematic tracking of changes from inception to archive
- **Clarity Taxonomy**: Standardized framework for requirement clarification and refinement
- **Version Control Integration**: Git-based workflow aligned with development processes
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Optimized for use with GitHub Copilot and similar AI tools

### Project Structure

The RDD methodology organizes project documentation in the `.rdd-docs/` directory:

```
.rdd-docs/
├── requirements.md          # Project requirements
├── tech-spec.md            # Technical specifications
├── folder-structure.md     # Repository structure documentation
├── data-model.md           # Data model documentation
├── version-control.md      # Version control strategy
├── clarity-taxonomy.md     # Requirements clarification taxonomy
├── workspace/              # Current active work
│   └── change.md          # Active change documentation
└── archive/               # Historical changes
    ├── <change-name>/     # Archived change directories
    └── fixes/            # Bug fixes archive
```

### Core Workflow

1. **Document Requirements**: Define clear requirements in `requirements.md`
2. **Technical Design**: Document architecture and design in `tech-spec.md`
3. **Work on Changes**: Track current work in `workspace/change.md`
4. **Archive Completed Work**: Move completed changes to `archive/`
5. **Maintain Documentation**: Keep all documentation synchronized with code changes
